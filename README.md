Then click "Customize Toolbar." A window will open. On the very far left bottom is a checkbox "Titlebar". Check that to "On".

Inspired by and based on vStylers amazing Prowler Desktop theme on Windowblinds.

I contacted vStyler to request his permission to port this to gtk3. vStyler graciously agreed with stipulating that it be used for Non-Commercial Personal Desktop Use ONLY.
You may not copy and sell this theme. It is free to download, free to use on your personal machine.

This theme is made without an assets directory - creating all images in .css for the gtk3 portion.
During the interim that I was awaiting word back from vStyler, I anticipated that he may not agree... So, I changed many aspects, adding my own style to them - the Checkboxes, the sliders, the progressbar and so on - in order to preserve my own work that I could make into a new theme should he decide he was unwilling to let me port to gtk3.
I decided to leave the changes as they are however... Since this is Based On vStylers work, but not really vStylers work - this is Prowler-2021 for Linux - a Dark Theme.

Fix Firefox:
Open "Customize Toolbar" and check the box for "titlebars".
